        "CNNs have revolutionised the field of computer vision in the last decade. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky introduced the AlexNet architecture to win the ImageNet Challenge (one of the most important competitions on image classification within the Computer Vision community), by reducing the top-5 error more than 10 percentage points, which was an incredible improvement at that time. As of now, CNNs are used not only on image classification but in many other computer vision tasks.\n",

The final shape of the image representation is conditioned on the type of problem/task that the architecture is facing. For instance, the output of the last layer in a classification problem is a probability vector. Each dimension of the probability vector represents how likely is that the input image belongs to a specific class. However, the architecture design is up to us, and therefore, we could code a network that outputs a single value for regression problems, or that generates a new image map for semantic segmentation. Now, let's dig in a bit into CNN and introduce some layers that are widely used. "

Convolutional layers are specifically designed to extract features from images or even extract features from previously extracted features. As shown in the following illustration, 2D convolutions apply the same filter to the full image.

The following images and some explanations can be further explored on the original [Irhum Shafkat's blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1) or in the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) book.

Hence, network training aims to optimise the network's parameters (update the kernel weights) such that the cost function is minimised. \n",

This generated feature map can go through another 2D convolutional layer and create more powerful features. \n",

The bigger the size of the kernel is, the more feature elements contribute to the final output value. In contrast to fully connected layers, where a new feature value is a weighted sum over **all** input values, as mentioned, 2D convolutions compute features based on local areas. In other words, instead of looking at every input component, they consider only features coming from close locations. \n",

        "The stride operation allows the convolutional layers to skip some of the sliding windows explained above. Hence, instead of jumping one pixel apart, we can define the number of skipped elements before computing the weighting sum between the kernel's weights and input features. A stride of 1 means that features will be extracted from all windows a pixel apart, so basically, every single window is computed. A stride of 2 means that we are selecting windows 2 pixels apart, skipping every other window in the process. Strides reduce the number of computations and consequently the size of the output map. In practice, as we go deeper into the CNN, the spatial size of the feature map gets smaller while the number of channels increases. Moreover, we can further reduce the size of the feature map using pooling operations, which we introduce later in this tutorial.\n",

However, when dealing with RGB images or feature maps, the input is no longer a single-channel map but, instead, they can have multiple channels. In the case of an RGB image, for each 2D convolution, we will need to define 3 kernels to interact with each of the image's channel colours. This group of kernels is called a filter. Thus, a filter is a collection of kernels that produces a single output.\n",

        "As a regular practice when defining Deep Learning models, we increase the number of filters in each convolutional layer as we go deeper into the model. Due to the element-wise multiplication, the number of kernels on each filter must be the same that the number of channels in the input feature map. Keras already deals with the number of kernels inside each filter. Keras keeps track of the input size in each convolutional layer unlike other frameworks (Pytorch or TensorFlow). Hence, in Keras, we must only decide the number of filters (output channels) in each layer.\n",

Those activation functions are a set of operators that maps the feature values to a new set of values, the mapping depends on the function at hand. The main reason for using activation functions is that they add non-linearities to the network, giving more expressive power to the network, which will be able to reproduce more complex functions. \n",

It sets all negative values to 0 and hence is computationally easy to implement. As a drawback, during training some neurons *die*, meaning that the output is 0 for all available data points and no gradient is propagated there. `keras.activations.relu(x, alpha=0.0, max_value=None, threshold=0.0)`:\n",

This function sets all of the output elements to the range (0, 1). However, the softmax function does not take independently the input values to map it into its probability value. Softmax Function takes an un-normalized vector, $s$, and normalizes it into a probability distribution, $p$, following the softmax expression. As the output is a probability, the output elements add up to 1. `keras.activations.softmax(x, axis=-1)`. Thus, the output value $p_i$ is computed as:\n",

In a standard CNN architecture, we set the feature sizes to become smaller progressively to reduce the computation in the networks, and to merge the information from different spatial locations. To reduce the feature map sizes, we can either use bigger stride size in the convolutional layers or we can use pooling layers. Pooling layers perform a spatial sliding window and apply an operation to reduce the spatial size. Those operations vary depending on the architecture, being the max, mean and min pooling the most typical ones. Here, we will explain the max pooling, although all the others work similarly. Max pooling keeps only the max value in a neighbourhood, where the neighbourhood is defined by the size of the kernel. Let's visualise it, the next example shows the result of a Max Pooling layer with a 2x2 kernel and a stride of 2.\n",

In this first task, we want you to create a CNN that is able to outperform the Multi-layer Perceptron model from Tutorial 1. For the first part of the coursework, we train on CIFAR10, a  classical dataset for image classification. Note that in these tutorials, we mainly use the official test sets of several standard datasets as our validation data. The reason we use the given test sets as validation data for the tutorials is that is an easy way to make sure that we all work with the same split and report results using the same data. However, in a proper machine learning setup, your validation set should be separate from the test set, so you can tune the model/parameters on the validation set and then check the final performance in the test set. Thus, even though the variables are `x_test` and `y_test`, they represent our validation set.\n",
